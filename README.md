## Hello, my little sunshine! âœ¨

Hi, I'm Isaac, and I'm a bachelor student in Computer Engineering at a public university in Brazil. I like to have a mentality like a  
sunflower, with my back to the shadows and my face to the sun, focusing on growth and getting better day by day with my tech skills.   

My first and main programming-language its: Python, with i have a more experience(Front, and BackEND), but i really like to be a  
WEB Designer using a some Markup Language like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
